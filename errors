To upgrade Liquibase installed on a Linux server, you can follow these steps:

Check Current Version: Determine the current version of Liquibase installed on your server. You can do this by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
liquibase --version
This command will display the current version of Liquibase installed.

Download New Version: Visit the Liquibase website (https://www.liquibase.org/) and download the latest stable version of Liquibase. You can download the binary distribution (ZIP or TAR) that corresponds to your operating system.
wget -O liquibase.zip https://download.liquibase.org/download/liquibase-core-4.21.1-bin.zip

Extract the Archive: Extract the downloaded Liquibase archive to a directory of your choice. You can use the following command to extract a ZIP archive:

bash
Copy code
unzip liquibase-x.x.x.zip
Replace "liquibase-x.x.x.zip" with the name of the downloaded archive.

Move Liquibase: Move the extracted Liquibase directory to a location where you want to store it on your server. For example, you can move it to /opt/liquibase:

bash
Copy code
sudo mv liquibase-x.x.x /opt/liquibase
Update Environment Variables: Update the system's environment variables to include the Liquibase binary in the PATH variable. Open the file /etc/environment in a text editor and add the following line at the end:

bash
Copy code
PATH="/opt/liquibase:$PATH"
Save the file and exit the text editor.

Verify Upgrade: Open a new terminal or run source /etc/environment in the existing terminal to reload the environment variables. Then, run the following command to check if the new version of Liquibase is recognized:

bash
Copy code
liquibase --version
The output should display the new version of Liquibase that you installed.

That's it! You have successfully upgraded Liquibase on your Linux server. You can now use the new version of Liquibase for your database change management tasks. Remember to update any relevant scripts or automation that reference the Liquibase installation path.
