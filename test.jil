The idea we have for Autosys deployment CICD is as follows:

The developers will push the jil file into the GitHub repository
We will trigger the Jenkins pipeline where all the jil files that need to be deployed is copied to the Autosys server and jil command will be executed.

 

So, could you please help us with commands we need to execute for deploying the jil files  into the server.
